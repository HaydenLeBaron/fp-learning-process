<p>This training will use the <a href="https://twitter.com/lambda_conf/status/803695008100466688">Standardized Ladder of Functional Programming</a> to guide what is covered and in which order.</p>

<h2 id="specific-criticisms-of-ladder">Specific Criticisms of Ladder</h2>

<p>There are some valid criticisms of the ladder. First, the terms used are focused on the Haskell eco system and typed functional programming languages, not functional programming in general. Second, especially at the mid and higher levels, there are concepts that may be of less value based on the situation.</p>

<p>Regardless of the criticisms, there is value that can be derived, specifically additional ideas to explore and understand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>more seriously, this to me reflects a broken value system that prizes fancy types over everything else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The language here is also presumptuous. To be proficient, you must know about codata and extensible effects. Absurd.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/kana-sama/735549b8baaa783d6fc563e65f3299d5">This gist</a> uses categories for each concept and skill to guage their understanding at a period in time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Know about it</li>
  <li>Understanding</li>
  <li>Clear understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe a more nuanced way of grouping:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have never heard of this</li>
  <li>I have heard of this but have no understanding of the concept/skill</li>
  <li>I understand the basic concept/skill, but donâ€™t feel confident using it</li>
  <li>I feel confident in using the concept/skill, but may need to reference examples</li>
  <li>I can use and understand this concept/skill intuitively (without conscious reasoning; instinctively)</li>
</ul>
