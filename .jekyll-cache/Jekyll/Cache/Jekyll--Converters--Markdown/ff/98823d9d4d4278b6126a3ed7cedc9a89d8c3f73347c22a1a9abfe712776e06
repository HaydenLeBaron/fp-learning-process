<p>There are numerous resources and paths to learn functional programming. The objective of this process will specifically target learning terminology and fundamentals that will hopefully provide a base of knowledge that you can build on.</p>

<p>This will attempt to target two audiences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developers with a background in programming, but little functional programming experience</li>
  <li>Developers that have a good handle on FP in daily activities, but want to improve their â€˜academicâ€™ basis of understanding around terminology and concepts
    <ul>
      <li>â€˜Level you upâ€™ with stronger fundamentals</li>
      <li>Explore additional concepts and types you may not have seen before</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are plenty of blog articles with personal opinions around these concepts, please search out these articles to explore further.</p>

<p>But, this methodology will use less prose to explain concepts. Instead examples will be used to explain the concepts, to build an intuition around how they may be applied.</p>

<p>Additionally, examples will focus on usage in a â€˜businessâ€™ or â€˜enterpriseâ€™ setting. CS concepts that â€˜self-taughtâ€™ developers will be less familiar with, will be used sparingly.</p>
